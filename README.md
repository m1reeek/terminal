# terminal
Moja nieukończona gra, proszę się pośmiać z mojego kodu.. // My unfinished game, feel free to laugh at my code lol. The entire documentation will be in english for now.
# What's up with this game?
This was my little project for a while, I've always dreamt to create a game like this.
I was on a vacation recently, and worked on this game on my laptop with ubuntu, the terminal.old was the backup of the game when i was only using windows.
I'm going to rewrite the entirety of this game, because of its... bloatware i think. The new version could be played on my webpage/server in a few months (I think).
Feel free to do whatever you would want to do with this code, but beware because it's all undocumented.
